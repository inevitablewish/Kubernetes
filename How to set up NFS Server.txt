How to set up Network File Storage in Debain and Red Hat
For Redhat / AWS
Firstly update the packages by using sudo yum update

1. Install nfs-utilities in the server
		sudo yum install nfs-utils
2. Enable the nfs-server after installation
		sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server
3. We must also start the rpcbind service, which NFS uses for port mapping
		sudo systemctl enable --now rpcbind
4. Create a Directory that you would like to share
		sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder
5. Export the directory you would like to share to broadcast to the network.
		echo "/mnt/sharedfolder 172.31.0.0/16(rw)" > /etc/exports -- valid for subnet or VPC
6. Change the ownership of the Directory for its accessibility
		sudo chown nobody:nobody /mnt/sharedfolder
		sudo chmod 775 /mnt/sharedfolder
7. Broadcast the exported directory
		sudo exportfs -r
8. Install the firewall is not already installed
		sudo yum install firewall*
9. Enable and start firewalld
		sudo systemctl enable firewalld
		sudo systemctl start firewalld
8. Add the nfs service to firewall so it is accessible through the network.
		sudo firewall-cmd --add-service nfs --permanent

It should print success if worked
=============================
Setup client server

1. Create a directory that you would like to share
		sudo mkdir /nfs/imports/myshare
2. Then mount the NFS Volume
		sudo mount -v -t nfs 192.168.122.17:/nfs/exports/myshare /nfs/imports/myshare/
3. This setting can be permanenet by following
		192.168.122.17:/nfs/exports/myshare   /nfs/imports/myshare/  nfs  rw 0 0
4. Verify the mount
		mount | grep -i nfs 
5. It should show the following outcome
		192.168.122.17:/nfs/exports/myshare on /nfs/imports/myshare ...

===============================
Testing

1. SSH into the Node/ Instance where NFS is set up
		ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@instance-ip 
2. Once in the NFS server, go to /nfs/exports/myshare to confirm if it is existing.
